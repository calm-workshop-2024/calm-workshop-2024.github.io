</div>

All talks will be recorded and made available to registered participants after the workshop through the NeurIPS website.

## Poster Sessions

All accepted papers will be presented as a poster at the workshop. All posters should be put up in the morning (e.g., during the first break) and will remain up during the whole day, and presenters may present in either or both of the two poster sessions. 

For virtual participants, we encourage you to view the papers on OpenReview and reach out to the authors directly, for example through the NeurIPS virtual platform.


## Invited Talks

<!-- We have some amazing invited speakers lined up for the workshop! -->

<!-- The abstracts for the invited talks will be listed here as they become available. -->

### Amit Sharma: Teaching causal reasoning to language models

Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable accuracy in identifying cause-and-effect relationships across diverse scientific domains. However, their ability to reason over these relationships remains a challenge. To address this, we propose axiomatic training—a novel approach that enhances causal reasoning by teaching LLMs fundamental causal axioms one at a time, rather than fine-tuning them for specific tasks. By training on synthetic demonstrations of axioms such as transitivity and d-separation, we show that models with fewer than 100 million parameters can surpass reasoning capabilities of significantly larger models such as Phi-3, Gemini Pro and GPT-4. Axiomatic training has practical applications as a tool for constructing verifiers for LLM-generated reasoning and for embedding inductive biases into LLM fine-tuning. Moreover, it provides insights into how models like GPT-4, trained solely on observational data, can exhibit advanced reasoning capabilities.
