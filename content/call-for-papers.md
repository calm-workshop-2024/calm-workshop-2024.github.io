# Call for Papers & Reviewers

## [Submit](https://openreview.net/group?id=NeurIPS.cc/2024/Workshop/CALM) your paper or [sign up](https://forms.gle/rby9yB8ufWBPXxJC9) to be a reviewer!

Our workshop aims to explore the many exciting synergies between causality and large models. We identify four main directions to cover in our workshop:

* Causality *for* large models: Applying ideas from causality to improve large models.

* Causality *with* large models: Leveraging large models to improve causal inference.

* Causality *in* large models: Assessing the causal knowledge captured by large models and their (causal) reasoning abilities.

* Causality *of* large models: Investigating the causal structure of how large models work and how to make them more interpretable and controllable.

In addition to the directions discussed above, we welcome contributions that explore the vibrant interface between causality and large models, for example:

* Theoretical and empirical studies on how large models employ causal knowledge and reasoning

* Combined applications of large models and causal methods to real-world problems for improved performance and interpretability

* Connections between multiple modalities (such as images, text, and audio) and (causal) reasoning abilities of large models

* Applications of causal inference methods to understand or improve large models

Submissions should present novel, unpublished work. Work that previously appeared in non-archival venues (such as arXiv or other workshops without proceedings) is allowed. All submitting authors are required to have an OpenReview profile: please ensure that these are up-to-date before submitting. 

For authors who do not already have an OpenReview profile, please be aware of OpenReview's moderation policy for newly created profiles:
* New profiles created without an institutional email will go through a moderation process that can take up to two weeks.
* New profiles created with an institutional email will be activated automatically.

Our anonymity policy is double-blind.

The C♥️LM workshop is non-archival, and should thus generally not violate dual submission policies at other archival venues (e.g., submitting work that is currently under review at another conference is permitted); if unsure, please check yourself with the corresponding venue.

## Style & Author Instructions

Submissions should be formatted using our latex style files (available [here](https://github.com/calm-workshop-2024/calm-workshop-2024.github.io/raw/main/style_files/neurips_2024_calm.zip)). Papers should be submitted as a PDF file and should be 4-6 pages in length, including all main results, figures, and tables. Appendices containing additional details are allowed, but reviewers are not expected to take this into account.

The workshop will not have proceedings (it will not be archival), which means you can submit the same or extended work as a publication to other venues after the workshop.



<!-- We welcome submissions related to any aspects of CRL, including but not limited to:

* Learning latent (structural) causal models & structured (deep) generative models
* Interventional representations, causal digital twins & structured (causal) world models
* Post-hoc extraction of causal relations from (deep) generative models
* Self-supervised causal representation learning
* Multi-environment & multi-view causal representation learning
* Micro vs. macro/coarse-grained/multi-level causal systems
* Identifiable representation learning & nonlinear ICA
* Uncertainty quantification in (causal) representation learning
* Group-theoretic & symmetry-based views on disentanglement
* Invariance & equivariance in representation learning
* Interdisciplinary perspectives on causal representation learning, including from cognitive science, psychology, (computational) neuroscience or philosophy
* Real-world applications of causal representation learning, including in biology, medical sciences, or robotics


Submissions should present novel, unpublished work. Work that previously appeared in non-archival venues (such as arXiv or other workshops without proceedings) is allowed.

The CRL workshop is non-archival, and should thus generally not violate dual submission policies at other archival venues (e.g., submitting work that is currently under review at another conference such as NeurIPS is permitted); if unsure, please check yourself with the corresponding venue. -->
