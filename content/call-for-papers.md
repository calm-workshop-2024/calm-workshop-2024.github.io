# Call for Papers

Our workshop aims to explore the many exciting synergies between causality and large models. We identify four main directions to cover in our workshop:

* Causality in large models: Assessing the causal knowledge captured by large models and their (causal) reasoning abilities.

* Causality for large models: Applying ideas from causality to augment and improve large models.

* Causality with large models: Leveraging large models to improve causal inference and discovery.

* Causality of large models: Investigating the causal structure of how large models work and how to make them more interpretable and controllable.

In addition to the directions discussed above, we welcome contributions that explore the vibrant interface between causality and large models, for example:

* Theoretical and empirical studies on how large models employ causal knowledge and reasoning

* Combined applications of large models and causal methods to real-world problems for improved performance and interpretability

* Connections between multiple modalities (such as images, text, and audio) and (causal) reasoning abilities of large models

* Applications of causal inference methods to understand or improve large models

Submissions should present novel, unpublished work. Work that previously appeared in non-archival venues (such as arXiv or other workshops without proceedings) is allowed. All submitting authors are required to have an OpenReview profile: please ensure that these are up-to-date before submitting. 

For authors who do not already have an OpenReview profile, please be aware of OpenReview's moderation policy for newly created profiles:
* New profiles created without an institutional email will go through a moderation process that can take up to two weeks.
* New profiles created with an institutional email will be activated automatically.

Our anonymity policy is double-blind.

The C♥️LM workshop is non-archival, and should thus generally not violate dual submission policies at other archival venues (e.g., submitting work that is currently under review at another conference is permitted); if unsure, please check yourself with the corresponding venue.
