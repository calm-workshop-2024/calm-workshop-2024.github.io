      <description>About the workshop The remarkable capabilities and accessibility of recent large models, also known as “foundation models,” have sparked significant interest and excitement in the research community and beyond. In particular, large pre-trained generative models have demonstrated remarkable competencies in understanding and generating human-like text despite being trained on largely unstructured data using relatively simple self-supervised learning objectives. This raises the question: (A) Why do such large models work so well?</description>

      <description>Call for Papers &amp;amp; Reviewers Submit your paper or sign up to be a reviewer! Our workshop aims to explore the many exciting synergies between causality and large models. We identify four main directions to cover in our workshop:&#xA;Causality for large models: Applying ideas from causality to improve large models.&#xA;Causality with large models: Leveraging large models to improve causal inference.&#xA;Causality in large models: Assessing the causal knowledge captured by large models and their (causal) reasoning abilities.</description>

      <description>Formatting Instructions Style &amp;amp; Author Instructions Submissions should be formatted using our latex style files (available here). Papers should be submitted as a PDF file and should be 4-6 pages in length, including all main results, figures, and tables. Appendices containing additional details are allowed, but reviewers are not expected to take this into account.&#xA;The workshop will not have proceedings (it will not be archival), which means you can submit the same or extended work as a publication to other venues after the workshop.</description>

      <description>Workshop Schedule &amp;amp; Format A detailed schedule will be posted here closer to the workshop date.&#xA;Our workshop will feature a mix of invited talks, a poster session, a panel discussion, and interactive elements to engage the audience and foster discussion. Consequently, we do not expect to need any special equipment.&#xA;We plan to hold a series of six invited talks given by both up-and-coming as well as distinguished researchers with experience in the intersection of causality and large models, as well as a panel discussion for deeper dialogue on the workshop&amp;rsquo;s main themes.</description>
