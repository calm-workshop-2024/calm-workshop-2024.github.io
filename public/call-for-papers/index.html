<p>Our workshop aims to explore the many exciting synergies between causality and large models. We identify four main directions to cover in our workshop:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Causality <em>for</em> large models: Applying ideas from causality to improve large models.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Causality <em>with</em> large models: Leveraging large models to improve causal inference.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Causality <em>in</em> large models: Assessing the causal knowledge captured by large models and their (causal) reasoning abilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Causality <em>of</em> large models: Investigating the causal structure of how large models work and how to make them more interpretable and controllable.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the directions discussed above, we welcome contributions that explore the vibrant interface between causality and large models, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Theoretical and empirical studies on how large models employ causal knowledge and reasoning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Combined applications of large models and causal methods to real-world problems for improved performance and interpretability</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Connections between multiple modalities (such as images, text, and audio) and (causal) reasoning abilities of large models</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Applications of causal inference methods to understand or improve large models</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Submissions should present novel, unpublished work. Work that previously appeared in non-archival venues (such as arXiv or other workshops without proceedings) is allowed. All submitting authors are required to have an OpenReview profile: please ensure that these are up-to-date before submitting.</p>
<p>For authors who do not already have an OpenReview profile, please be aware of OpenReview&rsquo;s moderation policy for newly created profiles:</p>
<ul>
<li>New profiles created without an institutional email will go through a moderation process that can take up to two weeks.</li>
<li>New profiles created with an institutional email will be activated automatically.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our anonymity policy is double-blind.</p>
<p>The C♥️LM workshop is non-archival, and should thus generally not violate dual submission policies at other archival venues (e.g., submitting work that is currently under review at another conference is permitted); if unsure, please check yourself with the corresponding venue.</p>
<p>Please find more information and a list of selected references <a href="https://calm-workshop-2024.github.io/about/">here</a></p>
<h2 id="style--author-instructions">Style &amp; Author Instructions</h2>
<p>Submissions should be formatted using our latex style files (available <a href="https://github.com/calm-workshop-2024/calm-workshop-2024.github.io/raw/main/style_files/neurips_2024_calm.zip">here</a>). Papers should be submitted as a PDF file and should be 4-6 pages in length, including all main results, figures, and tables. Appendices containing additional details are allowed, but reviewers are not expected to take this into account.</p>
<p>The workshop will not have proceedings (it will not be archival), which means you can submit the same or extended work as a publication to other venues after the workshop.</p>
<h2 id="important-dates">Important Dates</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Paper submission deadline: September 06, 2024, AoE</strong></li>
<li><strong>Notification to authors: October 09, 2024, AoE</strong></li>
<li><strong>Camera-ready version: TBA</strong></li>
<li><strong>Workshop Date: December 14 or 15, 2024 - TBD, AoE</strong></li>

<!-- We welcome submissions related to any aspects of CRL, including but not limited to:

* Learning latent (structural) causal models & structured (deep) generative models
* Interventional representations, causal digital twins & structured (causal) world models
* Post-hoc extraction of causal relations from (deep) generative models
* Self-supervised causal representation learning
* Multi-environment & multi-view causal representation learning
* Micro vs. macro/coarse-grained/multi-level causal systems
* Identifiable representation learning & nonlinear ICA
* Uncertainty quantification in (causal) representation learning
* Group-theoretic & symmetry-based views on disentanglement
* Invariance & equivariance in representation learning
* Interdisciplinary perspectives on causal representation learning, including from cognitive science, psychology, (computational) neuroscience or philosophy
* Real-world applications of causal representation learning, including in biology, medical sciences, or robotics


Submissions should present novel, unpublished work. Work that previously appeared in non-archival venues (such as arXiv or other workshops without proceedings) is allowed.

The CRL workshop is non-archival, and should thus generally not violate dual submission policies at other archival venues (e.g., submitting work that is currently under review at another conference such as NeurIPS is permitted); if unsure, please check yourself with the corresponding venue. -->
